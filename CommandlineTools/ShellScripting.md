`$*` / `$@`                                   | get all given parameters
`$[number]`                                   | get call parameter
`if [ condition ]` <br> `then` <br> `...` <br>`elif [ conition2 ]` <br> `...` <br> `else` <br>`...` <br> `fi` | if - condition
`[ string1 = string2 ]`                       | true if both strings are identical
`[ string1 != string2 ]`                      | true if both strings are not identical
`[ -n string ]`                               | true if string is not zero
`[ -z string ]`                               | true if string is zero
`[ value1 -eq value2 ]`                       |Â true if values are the same, other options are <br> `-ne` (not equal) <br> `-gt` (greater than) <br> `-ge` (greater than or equal) <br> `-lt` (less than) <br> `-le` (less than or equal to) <br> `!value` (not)

`set -e`                                      | Shell scripts exit on error
`cut -d ":" -f 1` | splits each input line at the ":" character
`${#STRING}` | return number of characters contained by a string
`getopts` | Program which parses command line options
`readarray -t arrayName < <(InputCommand)` | Split input lines into shell array
